                            I just love building things! Whether it's a new feature for a client or a personal project
                            like this website to which I wrote a resume builder ðŸ˜‰, I enjoy the process of creating and
                            problem-solving. Outside of work, Iâ€™m an avid triathlete who enjoys the discipline and
                            mental clarity that comes with endurance training. I also have a passion for reading -
                            particularly on topics related to technology. I spend my downtime watching sports, hanging
                            with family, and checking items off the honey-do list!
